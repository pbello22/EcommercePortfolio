## Business Context/Scenario

This dashboard was created for the **Analytics team at a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace** to help the Operations and Growth teams monitor performance, understand customer behavior, and guide decision-making around marketing, logistics, and promotions.

Key business questions this dashboard helps answer:

- How are revenue and orders trending over time?
- What‚Äôs the average order value and how does it shift?
- Which product categories drive the most sales volume?
- How do customers prefer to pay, and are promos overused?
- Where are our highest-value customers located?
- Which sellers are generating the most revenue and volume?
- Which regions have the highest customer concentration?

This dashboard uses realistic e-commerce transaction data (simulated) and is designed to be used by:
- The **Operations team** (delivery times, region analysis)
- The **Growth & Marketing team** (category performance, AOV)
- The **Finance team** (payment method breakdown)

It supports custom date ranges and is meant to be reviewed on a **weekly or monthly basis**.

All data visualizations and metrics are powered by SQL queries written in BigQuery SQL syntax. Each query is:

- Fully parameterized using `${inputs.date_filter.start}` and `${inputs.date_filter.end}` for dynamic filtering
- Designed for **performance and clarity** (using joins, aggregations, and window functions)
